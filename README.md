# Cat-and-Dog-Classifier
In this project, we will classify Dog and Cat images using Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

As classification is an important part as we want to distinguish if an image has a cat or a dog. We used CNN for classification as given below:

We used 10 epochs for training our dataset with 2000 Training images, 50 Testing images and 1000 images for validation  

The number layers which we used were self-designed but you can also use other models such as AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, etc the model summary is given below:

### Implementation:

To implement this code you need basic or no knowledge of Convolution NUeral Network.
And all the libraries used in this code are basic Neural Network Libraries. You can either train it on your own PC or use google colab for the training process and use their GPUs for training.
You just have to download the code file give it the location of your dataset and run the code if all the libraries are installed on your PC or just run it on colab if you don't want to install the libraries on your PC. You can also change this code to classify more than two classes with ease. 

**Libraries used:**

 1-Numpy
 
 2-Pandas
 
 3-Keras
 
 4-OpenCv
 
 5-Tensorflow
 
 6-Matplot

## Running of the code
You can run the code by just downloading the notebook and running it on Jupyter or upload on Google Colab and run it over there.
You don't need to download the dataset as I have already linked the dataset in the notebook it will auto-download when you run the code.
